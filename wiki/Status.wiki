#Current Status.

= Introduction =

We have the following kernels available for running Linux on the device :-

 * Wits linux image - kernel 2.6.29
 * Wits android image - kernel 2.6.32
 * TI OMAP kernel tree - kernel 2.6.35
 * Mainline kernel
 * (add more relevant ones here)

To boot the kernel X-Loader and u-boot are required too.

The MLO (X-loader) and u-boot combination that came with Wits linux image v2.6.29 kernel can boot only v 2.6.29 and v2.6.32.

The android images come with their own MLO and u-boot that generally boot the kernel from NAND.


= Details =

Currently

  * Simon and avionion are trying to get a custom MLO and u-boot combination going. They've got a version that boots any kernel but are stuck at getting the LCD to init.
  * I'm trying to get wifi working with any kernel. I'm stuck trying to get the TI kernel to compile cleanly.
  * Arlen already has an enlightenment based rootfs ready. Works fine with the android kernel, MLO and u-boot.
