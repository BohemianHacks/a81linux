#How to set up a serial port for the Wits A81/A81E

= Introduction =

There are 2 ways
  # Open up the tablet, solder 4 wires onto the RS232 pads to get 1.8V TTL output
  # Tap the USB B port to get 1.8V TTL output


= Details =

*# Open up the tablet*

  On the right side of the PCB above the cut portion (where a USB A Female connector fits) you'll find 4 pads. From top to bottom they're
 
 # Rx
 # Tx
 # Gnd
 # 1.8v

*# Newer Batches of A81E *
I think there is little change in newer production batches PCB, as shown below. Now they don't print the details of RS232 Pins but still they have the same sequence as shown above i.e. starting from top pin (near to earphone jack), we have

 # Rx
 # Tx
 # Gnd
 # 1.8v

In order to use FTDI Basic board (sku: DEV-08772 and not the latest DEV-10009) you must cut the track on backside of the board between center pad and pad towards your right side (I will update with pics later). then you can use 1.8v from a81e use this usb to rs232 converter. 

*# USB Port*

 From what we know as of now the serial port is also available off the USB B port on the A81E like so :-

  GND on pin 5 (USB GND)
  TXD on pin 4 (USB ID)
  RXD on pin 3 (USB D+)

  All at 1.8v TTL levels. 

 (Can someone confirm this? I couldn't get this to work - while Simon could. Might be my breadboard FTDI circuit.)
